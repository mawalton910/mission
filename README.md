# Guru Games - Mission - POI Story System
**Current Version**: POIStory v26.5.2
**Platform**: ESP32-S3 (Crabik SLot ESP32-S3) with M5Stack Dial  
**Maintained by**: mawalton910

A location-based mission tracking system built on the M5Stack Dial (ESP32-S3) for immersive story-driven gameplay in live-action role-playing events.

## Current game-configured mission flow

v26.5.2 fixes a black screen during startup: the optional Port A bus scan no
longer runs at boot, and the Serial `I2C` diagnostic skips reserved addresses
that can freeze the ESP32-S3. A startup message appears before reader setup.
It also releases request/HTTPS buffers before parsing and grows JSON memory
only as needed (up to the existing 64 KiB limit). This avoids a `NoMemory`
failure from reserving one large heap block for a small, valid setup. Serial
diagnostics include the HTTP status and JSON failure reason.

See [Game setup and offline checkpoint guide](Documents/GAME_CONFIGURATION.md) for v26.5.1. Set the game ID, download the Creator configuration at boot, scan an NPC card to start, and visit four assigned POIs offline. Players can check in and out throughout the mission; the final checked-in crew receives the full earned tier when the same NPC confirms completion. RFID2 is supported on Port A. The guide covers Creator card mapping, refresh, storage recovery and Serial messages.

The feature overview below also describes the legacy local mission modes. The game-configured four-POI flow uses the NPC's round assignment and the game's Mission Difficulty rewards.

##  Mission System

### Mission Categories
| Category | Theme |
|---|---|
| Heist | High-stakes robbery operations |
| Police | Law enforcement missions |
| Hacking | Digital infiltration tasks |
| Job | Professional assignments |
| Vehicle | Transportation-based missions |
| Drug | Pharmaceutical operations |
| Medical | Healthcare-related tasks |
| Community | Social service missions |

### Difficulty & Rewards
Difficulty is earned based on locations visited:

| Locations Visited | Difficulty |
|---|---|
| 1 | Easy |
| 2 | Medium |
| 3 | Hard |
| 4 | Extreme |

Respect rewards scale with difficulty and are distributed automatically by the server.

### Mission Timer
- **Configurable Countdown**: Set in `Config.h` via `MISSION_TIMEOUT_MIN` (default: 15 minutes)
- **On-Demand Display**: Press BtnA during a mission to see MM:SS remaining
- **Warning System**: Red "HURRY!" alert when under 60 seconds
- **Timeout Handling**:
  - No progress: Mission holds on a timeout screen; cleared by badge-reset or completion card scan
  - Some progress: Locks current difficulty level, screen shows "SCAN COMPLETION CARD"

---

##  Audio System

All buzzer tones are defined in `Sounds.h` as `Note[]` arrays  edit that file only.

| Sound | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `SND_BADGE_SCAN` | Badge scanned / player added |
| `SND_BADGE_REMOVED` | Player de-registered |
| `SND_MISSION_START` | Mission card accepted |
| `SND_LOCATION_VISIT` | Location tag scanned |
| `SND_MISSION_COMPLETE` | Mission pass fanfare |
| `SND_TIMEOUT` | Mission timer expired |
| `SND_ERROR` | Invalid scan / general error |
| `SND_MISSION_SCRUBBED` | GM scrubs an active mission |
| `SND_BADGE_COOLDOWN` | Blocked or scrubbed badge scanned |
| `SND_RESET` | Badge reset / full reset |
| `SND_SENDING_DOTS` | Ascending blips during "Sending..." animation |
| `SND_SERVER_HOLD` | Hold tone while waiting for primary server response |
| `SND_RESOURCE_HOLD` | Quieter hold tone for secondary resource POSTs |
| `SND_SERVER_RETRY` | Buzz between failed retry attempts |
| `SND_SAFE_CONFIRM` | Safe cracker exact-match beep |
| `SND_SAFE_PROX` | Safe cracker proximity radar (duration only; freq is dynamic) |

Each entry is `{frequency_hz, duration_ms}`. A frequency of `0` is a silent pause. Volume constants (`_VOL`) are defined next to each array.

---

##  Splash Screen

The device displays a custom 240240 JPEG logo on startup. To change it:
1. Replace `data/Logosmall.jpg` with your image (resize to 240240 JPEG)
2. Run `Documents/ConvertTone.ps1` to regenerate `GuruLogo.h`
3. Recompile and flash

See `Documents/SplashScreen.md` for full instructions.

---

##  Administrative Features

Scan an `ADMIN_BADGE_TAGS` card to enter admin mode. Navigate with the rotary encoder; press to select.

| Option | Function |
|---|---|
| Scan Tag Info | Identify any RFID tag  shows type, location name, resource type |
| Lock/Unlock Prop | HTTP POST to lock/unlock a prop by UUID |
| Toggle Dev Mode | ON: all missions use Guru Home (index 24). OFF: normal random locations |
| Mode Switch | Switch between Mission Widget, Buy Station, Relay |
| Exit | Return to current mode |

> Dev mode cannot bypass scrub cooldowns.

---

##  Mission Scrubbing

Game masters can force-end an active mission:
- Scan a `SCRUB_MISSION_TAGS` card while a mission is in progress
- All current player badges are placed on cooldown (same timer as normal completion)
- `SND_MISSION_SCRUBBED` tone plays to confirm
- Session cleared, device returns to badge-scan screen
- Scrubbed badges display a countdown timer and play `SND_BADGE_COOLDOWN` when scanned
- Scrub cooldowns **cannot** be bypassed by dev mode

---

##  Over-the-Air Updates

- Scan the OTA trigger card to start an update
- Device downloads firmware from GitHub, displays progress (percentage + bytes)
- Installs and reboots automatically

**Deploying new firmware**: Arduino IDE  Sketch  Export Compiled Binary  rename to `mission_M5.ino.bin`  commit to root of `main` branch.

---

##  Security & Anti-Abuse

- Physical RFID badge required for all missions
- Consecutive use prevention (different player must complete between same badge+mission pairs)
- Badge cooldown and scrub system (GM-enforced blocks that dev mode cannot bypass)
- Badge history tracking across power cycles
- Session timeout protection
- Server-side validation of all submissions

## Audio System  Developer Notes

### Tone Sequences with Volume Constants

| Array | `_VOL` constant | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `SND_BADGE_SCAN` | *(255)* | Badge scanned / any green screen confirm |
| `SND_BADGE_REMOVED` | *(255)* | Player de-registered |
| `SND_MISSION_START` | *(255)* | Mission card accepted |
| `SND_LOCATION_VISIT` | *(255)* | Location tag scanned successfully |
| `SND_MISSION_COMPLETE` | *(255)* | Mission submission fanfare |
| `SND_TIMEOUT` | *(255)* | Mission timer expired |
| `SND_ERROR` | *(255)* | Invalid scan / general error |
| `SND_MISSION_SCRUBBED` | *(255)* | GM scrub card scanned |
| `SND_BADGE_COOLDOWN` | *(255)* | Blocked/scrubbed badge scanned |
| `SND_RESET` | *(255)* | Badge reset / full reset |
| `SND_SENDING_DOTS` | `SND_SENDING_DOTS_VOL` | One blip per dot in "Sending..." animation |
| `SND_SERVER_HOLD` | `SND_SERVER_HOLD_VOL` | Hold tone  primary POST (stopped manually) |
| `SND_RESOURCE_HOLD` | `SND_RESOURCE_HOLD_VOL` | Hold tone  resource POST (quieter, stopped manually) |
| `SND_SERVER_RETRY` | *(255)* | Buzz between failed retry attempts |
| `SND_SAFE_CONFIRM` | `SND_SAFE_CONFIRM_VOL` | Safe cracker exact-match beep |
| `SND_SAFE_PROX` | `SND_SAFE_PROX_VOL` | Proximity radar (duration only; freq overridden at runtime) |

### Hold Tones
`SND_SERVER_HOLD` and `SND_RESOURCE_HOLD` use hardware I2S DMA and keep playing while the CPU blocks on `http.POST()`. Call `startSendHoldTone()` / `startResourceHoldTone()` before the POST and `Speaker.stop()` immediately after. Their `duration` must stay  `HTTP_TIMEOUT`.

### Wrapper Functions (`mission_M5.ino`)
`displayMessage()` calls these internally based on color argument:

| Function | Maps to | Triggered by color |
|---|---|---|
| `playSuccessTone()` | `SND_BADGE_SCAN` | `COLOR_SUCCESS`, `TFT_GREEN` |
| `playErrorTone()` | `SND_ERROR` | `COLOR_ERROR`, `TFT_RED` |
| `playAcceptTone()` | `SND_LOCATION_VISIT` | `COLOR_INFO`, `TFT_BLUE` |
| `playRemoveTone()` | `SND_BADGE_REMOVED` | *(called directly)* |

> Pass `TFT_WHITE` to `displayMessage()` to suppress the automatic tone when you have already played one explicitly.

---

## State Machine

```
WAIT_FOR_BADGE  WAIT_FOR_MISSION_CARD  RUN_MISSION
```

| State | Accepts |
|---|---|
| `WAIT_FOR_BADGE` | Badge tags, admin badge, full/badge reset cards |
| `WAIT_FOR_MISSION_CARD` | Mission cards, badge reset, full reset |
| `RUN_MISSION` | Location tags, completion tag, scrub tag, badge reset, timeout |

---

## Persistence (ESP32 Preferences)

**Namespace `story_mission`**  current session:
- `player_uuid`  Badge UID(s), comma-separated
- `player_class`  Mission category index
- `visited_count`  Locations visited
- `selected_locs`  Selected location indices
- `mission_start_ms`  Timer start time (restored on power loss)
- `locked_difficulty`  Difficulty value locked at timeout
- `saved_state`  Saved tracker state for badge-reset restore
- `saved_ms_start`  Mission start time saved on badge-reset

**Namespace `completed`**  badge cooldown history  
**SPIFFS `/mission_log.txt`**  timestamped event log, auto-truncates at 50KB

---

## Reset Cards

| Card | Effect |
|---|---|
| `FULL_RESET_TAGS` | Wipes all Preferences namespaces + deletes log file |
| `BADGE_RESET_TAGS` | Saves current state, clears badge, prompts re-scan; restores state on new badge |
| `SCRUB_MISSION_TAGS` | Force-ends active mission, places all player badges on scrub cooldown |

---

## Timeout Behavior

- **No locations visited**: Device holds on timeout screen. Resolves only via badge-reset or completion card (both wipe session and clear consecutive-use block).
- **1 location visited**: Difficulty locks at current level. Screen shows "SCAN COMPLETION CARD". Completion card submits the locked difficulty.

---

## Server Communication

### Mission Completion
**POST** `https://iot.rke.world/iot/secondaryMissionComplete`

```json
{
  "mac_address": "10:06:1C:82:FF:44",
  "serial_number": "mutantwarfare2secondary7",
  "difficulty": "Easy|Medium|Hard|Extreme",
  "uuid": "primary_badge_uid",
  "uuids": ["additional_badge_uid"]
}
```

### Resource Reward (one POST per collected resource type)
**POST** `https://iot.rke.world/iot/secondaryMissionComplete`

```json
{
  "mac_address": "10:06:1C:82:FF:44",
  "serial_number": "mutantwarfare2secondary7",
  "difficulty": "WEAPONS|SECURITY|VEHICLE|MONEY",
  "uuid": "primary_badge_uid",
  "uuids": ["additional_badge_uid"]
}
```

Both retry up to `MAX_HTTP_RETRIES` times with `HTTP_TIMEOUT` per attempt. Resource reward failures are non-critical  the mission is still marked complete.

### Audio During Send Sequence
1. Ascending blips (`SND_SENDING_DOTS`)  one per dot in the animation
2. 350Hz hold tone (`SND_SERVER_HOLD`)  plays from start of POST until server responds
3. On retry: short buzz (`SND_SERVER_RETRY`) during the 1-second wait
4. Secondary resource POSTs: 320Hz quieter hold (`SND_RESOURCE_HOLD`)
5. On final 200 response: `SND_MISSION_COMPLETE` fanfare, then pass screen

---

## OTA Updates

Configured in `OTAUpdate.h`:
```cpp
const char* GITHUB_USER = "mawalton910";
const char* GITHUB_REPO = "mission_M5";
const char* FIRMWARE_FILENAME = "mission_M5.ino.bin";
String targetBranch = "main";
```

**Deploy steps**:
1. Arduino IDE  Sketch  Export Compiled Binary
2. Rename to `mission_M5.ino.bin`
3. Commit to root of `main` branch on GitHub
4. Scan OTA trigger card on device  downloads, installs, reboots

---

## Log Viewer

Press BtnA while in `WAIT_FOR_BADGE` state to view `/mission_log.txt` on-device. Auto-closes after 30 seconds or on button press. Full reset clears the log.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Badge not scanning | Verify space-delimited hex format: `" AA BB CC DD"` |
| Cooldown not expiring | Check `BADGE_COOLDOWN_MS` in `Config.h` |
| Wrong resource scanned | Story highlights required resource in color  scan the matching tag only |
| Timer not persisting after power loss | Verify `stateManager.setMissionStartTime()` is called on mission start |
| WiFi "cannot set config" error | Fixed: `connectToWiFi()` checks existing connection before reconnecting |
| Sound not playing | Verify `M5Dial.Speaker.begin()` in setup; check `_VOL` constants in `Sounds.h` |
| Hold tone keeps playing | Ensure `Speaker.stop()` is called immediately after `http.POST()` returns |
| OTA fails | Verify binary is named `mission_M5.ino.bin` in the root of the `main` branch |
| Log file full | Logger auto-truncates at 50KB; use full reset to clear immediately |
| Dev mode not testing scrub | Scrub cooldowns bypass dev mode by design |
